# blender-scripting-intro
This is a simple introduction to scripting in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) with Python.

## Running the examples

To run the examples, go with your favorite console to the example folder, make sure that the blender executable is a environment variable and run the following command.

```
blender -b -P simple_sphere.py
```

Another option is to open the script in Blender and run the script there.
